    "In-Sample vs. Out-of-Sample Metrics: By generating metrics independently in each iteration, we observe potential differences in in-sample and out-of-sample errors. Often, in-sample metrics are slightly better because the model has been trained on this data, while out-of-sample metrics may be worse due to the model not having seen this data before.\n",
    "Variability in Performance: Not using np.random.seed allows each iteration to generate different random values, which mimics real-world model training where performance can vary depending on the specific data samples. This helps in understanding the robustness of the model. If out-of-sample errors are consistently higher, this may indicate overfitting.\n",
    "Practical Implication: By analyzing these metrics over multiple iterations, we gain insight into the stability and generalizability of the model. Ideally, the out-of-sample metrics should be close to the in-sample metrics, indicating good generalization."
